# YACT = Yet Another Calorie Tracker
This is a calorie / fitness tracker app

## Goals
A fitness app customized for my needs.
Self coded backend. Modern and slick design with easy to use UX.
Improve my skills as a software engineer outside of my internship.

## Rules
I will work on this project for at least 2 hours on weekdays and 4 hours on weekends. If not I'll have to phase punishment in form of a physical exercise.
Everytime I sit down to work on this project I will setup a timer for 2 hours. Everytime I stop being productive I will stop that timer.

This app has to be shipped on the 18th of June.
